    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Kessikbayev grew up in a military family in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. After his family emigrated to Russia shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kessikbayev followed in his fatherâ€™s footsteps and enrolled in the military, where his facility with technology earned him a spot in the coveted weapon testing brigade at Alabino firing range near Moscow.</p>
    <p>Kessikbayev is an expert tinkerer and a master craftsman, more at ease with the workings of machines than those of people. His gruff demeanor and curt speech should not be mistaken for misanthropy. He possesses a strong moral conviction.</p>
    <p>In 2004, Fuze had an altercation with SDU Operator Siu "Ying" Mei Lin, who considered him to be a "questionable asset" due to believing that he had a disregard for civilian lives. It was only after FBI SWAT Operator Eliza "Ash" Cohen stepped in to help resolve it. The events of this altercation were redacted.</p>
